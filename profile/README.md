Intensifying rain midway through the Boost Mobile Shootout has helped Cam Waters secure a second pole of 2024 while defending champion Brodie Kostecki will start just 15th in his first race of the season after a wild qualifying on Saturday morning.

Waters, who scored pole for the second race of the Melbourne SuperSprint, will share the front row for the inaugural ITM Taupō Super400 with championship leader Will Brown.

The Shootout began in wet conditions, before rain worsened after Brown, who was fourth driver out, set his timed lap.

By that time, Waters (#6 Monster Energy Ford) was on provisional pole with a 1:24.7415s ahead of Brown (#87 Red Bull Ampol Chevrolet) and local driver Andre Heimgartner (#8 R&J Batteries Chevrolet), with Tim Slade (#23 PremiAir Nulon Chevrolet) fourth.

From there, Ryan Wood (#2 Mobil 1 Truck Assist Ford), Cameron Hill (#4 Supaglass Chevrolet), Will Davison (#17 Shell V-Power Ford), Chaz Mostert (#25 Mobil 1 Optus Ford), Anton De Pasquale (#11 Shell V-Power Ford) and Matt Payne (#19 Penrite Ford) were unable to mount a challenge as conditions worsened.

Waters took the good luck, having slumped to 16th in the points standings through the first two rounds of the 2024 season.

“It was a pretty wild qualifying, half-dry and half-wet,” said Waters, who claimed his 25th career pole, and second in New Zealand.


“It was full-wet then, and obviously got pretty lucky with it getting wetter throughout the session.

“In saying that, the car was pretty hooked up and felt comfortable straight out the gate. I’ve had a lot of bad luck this year, so I’ll take a bit of good luck then, the team did a great job.”

The 60-lap Race 7 will start at 1:05pm AEST/3:05pm NZST.
